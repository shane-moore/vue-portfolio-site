        Working with Shane was better than expected and we had really high
        expectations. He is an incredibly talented developer but what really
        makes him stand out is his work ethic and steady approach. Time after
        time, and without us asking, he added enhancements and improvements that
        resulted in a better end product for us and our clients.
